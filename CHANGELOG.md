### Mine and Slash Class Updates
- A NEW CLASS HAS ARRIVED: Brawler! This combo-based class utilizes a string of Skills to decimate their foes. Their versatility in effects is unparalleled. Start with basic attacks to gain a Combo Starter stack, which is used to cast Combo Starter Skills. Combo Starter Skills will consume the stack and generate a Combo Linker stack, which is used by Combo Linkers. Similarly, Linkers will consume the Linker stack to generate a Combo Extender stack, which is finally consumed by a Combo Finisher. Explore the different combinations of Skills and create your own playstyle!
- ANOTHER?! NEW CLASS HAS ARRIVED: Crusader! Harnessing the power of the divine (Fire + Lightning), lay waste to enemies with new Skills or empower nearby allies with Auras. The new holy (Fire + Lightning) Skills can utilize Retribution stacks which are gained from blocking to become more defensive. However, Retribution stacks are optional. Auras are powerful buffs - only one can be equipped at a time. Most Auras empower your allies as well as yourself, but some Auras deal damage to enemies...
- A-N-O-T-H-E-R?!?!?!? NEW CLASS HAS ARRIVED: Chronomancer! This caster class utilizes the power of time (Cold + Lightning) to warp their enemies out of existence (not really). The Chronomancer utilizes 3 different types of stacks: Alpha, Beta, and Gamma. Depending on the configuration of stacks currently active, the Chronomancer's Skills become augmented. A lot of the Chronomancer Skills employ area control tactics and self-preservation through time manipulation!
