# Changelog

## [0.8.0] - 2024-12-03

### General Updates
- Create has been removed, and Botania has been added! This is a pretty big change that might be met with some resistance, but Botania fits the pack a lot better in terms of what it can provide. Some rewards from Botania are combat focused, in contrast to Create which were mostly automation-related. Additionally, Botania's performance and exploits are far far far less than what we had with Create.
- MineColonies has been replaced with Minecraft Comes Alive! In my head, both of these mods achieve very similar goals for what I wanted out of them. They both provide players an alternative way to manage their base - allowing them to play out the role of a leader of a town. However, the main difference is that Colonies was too parasitic in terms of time. If you started investing a bit of time into Colonies, you'd soon find yourself only messing with Colonies. Minecraft Comes Alive fixes this problem (in my opinion). First off, MCA replaces Villagers completely - this means more seamless integration with the RPG aspect of the pack. Not only does it let you play the role of a leader, you can even mingle and form relationships with the villagers. It's not longer just a 'side' thing, as you literally start off in a village!
- Overhauled biome generation with BYG, new dungeons, and an overhauled End!
- The End has new biomes and structures, and some new interesting gear that can be crafted.
- Increased Dungeons Arise structure spawn rates by about 25%.

- Gateway of Overworldian Nights now cost an additional 1 gold coin to craft.

- A lot of items have had their tech crafting requirements overhauled due to the removal of Create and addition of Botania.
- Added some new loading screen tips!
- Some unobtainable items are now hidden from JEI - thanks Elico!

### Mine and Slash General Updates
- New Craft to Exile 2 pre-Map mechanic! Mobs in dimensions up to and including Act V can now spawn Gateways on death. The Gateway they spawn depends on which dimension you're currently in! Successfully completing the Gateway gives you rewards which may include the Dimension-specific Rune!!!
- Cooldown Reduction now applies to Charge Cooldowns as well.
- Projectile Damage has been reworked. Instead of working on any Skills tagged with Projectile OR any Skills as long as user is wielding a bow, it now only works if the Skill is tagged with Projectile.
- Reduced base Mana and Energy Regen by 25%.
- Elemental Resist suffixes have been buffed by 25%.
- Players and Mobs now have a base Shock and Shatter Proc Chance of 10% and 5%, respectively.

- Profession Infusion and Gear Crafting has been reworked a bit so that the cost of Stone starts low and goes up as you increase in level instead of being based on rarity. Of course, the cost still goes up with rarity as it requires higher rarity Stone, but crafting a Common vs. Mythic at level 10 will still only cost 2 Stones each, instead of 4 and 24. There was also a bug where a bunch of recipes had the incorrect Stone rarity as part of the recipe.

- Lowered the crafting cost of Sharpening Stones.

- New Contributor-Designed Unique Helmet! Call of the Void, designed by Villain! This high-level helmet enables something players have been asking for... Low Health builds! With this helmet equipped, you can't regenerate Health or steal Health. You can still heal through Skills, however. The helmet provides the user a 20% chance to cast Healin
- New Contributor-Designed Unique Chest! Armor-Clad Faith, designed by Kaecie! This high-level chestplate provides increasing Damage Reduction the lower your Health. Additionally, it provides bonuses to Health, Grapple, and Knockback Resist at the expense of Attack and Move Speed!

- NEW Base Armor types!!! We now have dual-stat armors: Brigandine (STR/DEX), Chainmail (STR/INT), and Vest (INT/DEX). These armor types are fully integrated and come with their own new Uniques (found below).
- Dagger, Hammer, and Spear stat reqs have been increased by 25% to stay in line with the new Base Armor Types.
- Helmet implicits have been renamed and reworked. Each type of helmet (cloth/leather/plate) can roll from 4 different implicits, rather than all sharing from the same 5 implicits. That means 7 new implicits have been added, and existing ones reworked.
- Stat rarities have been reworked a bit, instead of lower rarities always rolling really bad stats (Common only rolled 0-10%), now all rarities have a chance of rolling the between stat range of 0-100%. However, higher rarities have lower volatility, eg. Rare is 30-100%, and Mythic is 75-100%. The number of affixes still increases with rarity, however.
- 26 new Uniques for the new armor types. There's too many to reveal in the changelog, so here are some hints. There's a Unique that provides a substantial bonus to Physical Resist, some Uniques that have interaction with Endurance/Power/Frenzy Charges, a Unique with a new Proc stat, a Unique that gives Jewel Sockets, a Unique that gives MORE Summon Damage per Power Charge. Check them out in the Hub Library!
- How Uniques drop has been reworked. They now have a minimum level AND Tier required before dropping. All Uniques have had their drop levels and Tiers adjusted. Every 10 levels, the pool of findable Uniques increases. Any Uniques that can drop below level 60 do not care about Tiers, meaning you can find these Uniques as you adventure! That means the pool of findable Uniques before Maps is now 108, up from 48! The remaining Uniques that drop starting at level 60 care about Tiers - every 20 Tiers more Uniques get introduced into the mix. The last currently findable Unique can be found in level 90 Maps, at Tier 100.

### Mine and Slash Map/Mob Updates
- Mobs and Bosses have had their scaling completely reworked. Feedback is appreciated. In general, mobs scale a lot harder now but multipliers from rarity, entity-specific configs, dimensions, tiers, etc., all scale much less. There should be fewer "gotcha" moments now. This allows me to scale mobs harder overall without worrying about outlier mobs as much. Of course, this can still happen but it will happen much less often.
