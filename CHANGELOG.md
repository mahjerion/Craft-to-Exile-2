### Mine and Slash General Updates
- New Mechanic: Ascendancies! You can now specialize your build further with Ascendancies. There are currently 16 Ascendancies. You get 1 Ascendancy point every 15 levels, capping at 7 points. You get an additional point at level 15. Ascendancies are NOT locked to certain Classes.
- New Map Mechanic: Prophecy! You can find altars in maps to apply curses to yourself. The more curses you have, the more Prophecy-specific currency you can gain from killing mobs. Use that currency to pick from deterministic rewards!
- New End-game Mechanic: Uber Bosses! Mobs in maps now have a chance to drop Uber Fragments, which can be combined into Uber Arena Maps. Enter the Arena Map, find the Uber Portal, and slay the Uber Boss for some powerful loot! Uber Bosses have a chance of dropping the coveted Abyss Jewels which can only be equipped in Jewel Slots if you're wearing the correct Augment. These Abyss Jewels grant very powerful effects!
- Maps now have a lives system. Higher rarity maps have less lives. When you run out of lives in a map, you can no longer enter it.
- You can no longer enter maps that are 3 levels higher than you.
- Maps now have some baseline Elemental Resistance requirement to enter, based on their difficult and rarity. Maps that have elemental mob damage affixes require higher resist. The required value isn't too high, this is mostly to help with players novice to ARPGs who are consistently getting one-shot.
- Maps now have names.
- Map Affixes now scale based on map rarity.
- Maps now contain modded mobs.
- Increased Map drop rate in non-maps from 0.35 to 0.5.
- Legendary and Mythic maps can drop in Epic maps now instead of one rarity lower. Epic maps can drop in common maps.
- Gems have been reworked! The level scaling is now linear and goes from 1-60 rather than 1-95. Additionally. the drop chance for higher tier Gems has increased. They were basically impossible to drop before. Gems have also gone through major stat changes. In general, stats from Gems is lower than Runes at the lowest tier, but by mid-tier they're on par, and by high-tier they're better. They also have some different stats not found on Runes.
- New Stat Type: Chaos/Corrupted Stats! Players from Craft to Exile might be familiar with this. When using an Orb of Chaos, there is a 75% chance to give the gear a powerful Chaos stat. However, there is a 25% chance that the gear will turn into a lump of coal. Thanks Len for your help!
- Non-Magic Skills now take into account the Caster's weapon type. So the Skill's damage can benefit from stats like "Sword Damage" if the Caster is holding a sword.
- New currency which rerolls a random affix.
- Currency Potential has been reworked. Items start with Potential which gets deducted from with each currency. At 0 potential, you can no longer apply currencies.
- Compatibility between Mine and Slash stats and non-Mine and Slash stats has been added. For example, the vanilla Armor stat now provides a small amount of percent Mine and Slash Armor. Compatibility has also been added for Armor Toughness (same as Armor), Attack Damage from weapons (adds a small amount of Total Damage), Vanilla Health (adds a small amount of percent Magic Shield), and Luck (adds a small amount of Magic Find).
- Compatibility between Mine and Slash stats and Minecraft Enchantments has been added. For example, Sharpness now increases Physical Damge by 4% per level. Any compat added to Enchantments will be reflected in the descriptions.
- Starting flat Critical Hit is now 4% instead of 5%.

- The above Support Gems have been added to their respective shops.
- The following Support Gems have been buffed by about 35%: Brutality, DoT Damage, Ailment Damage, Melee Damage, Ranged Damage.
- Projectile Support gems have been nerfed. Their damage penalties have increased. You will still deal more damage if all or most of the projectiles hit. This extra damage is proportionate to the resource multiplier (if all projectiles from GMP hit, you will do more than if all LMP projectiles hit).
- Increase AOE Support Gem now gives less AOE.
- Greater Multiple Projectiles Barrage fires one less projectile.
- Plate and Leather Chest pieces have had their values adjusted to be more in line with Cloth.
- Profession EXP now ranges from 50-100% if you are lower level than the resource, rather than 0-100%.
