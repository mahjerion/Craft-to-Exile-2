## [0.6.0b] - 2024-06-14

### Updates

- Halved gear weapon damage and defense scaling for all Uniques and Runewords due to the below fix. Overall, Uniques and Runewords should see a huge buff (of about 30%). For example, a level 80 staff with base of 50 damage would have rolled about 100-150% weapon damage, ending up at around 100-150 weapon damage. A level 80 Mythic would have been at about 92-100 base weapon damage alone, without considering the bonuses from the stats...

- New Map Mechanic: Prophecy! You can find altars in maps to apply curses to yourself. The more curses you have, the more Prophecy-specific currency you can gain from killing mobs. Use that currency to pick from deterministic rewards!
- New End-game Mechanic: Uber Bosses! Mobs in maps now have a chance to drop Uber Fragments, which can be combined into Uber Arena Maps. Enter the Arena Map, find the Uber Portal, and slay the Uber Boss for some powerful loot! Uber Bosses have a chance of dropping the coveted Abyss Jewels which can only be equipped in Jewel Slots if you're wearing the correct Augment. These Abyss Jewels grant very powerful effects!

- Map Affixes now scale based on map rarity.
- Maps now contain modded mobs.

They were basically impossible to drop before. Gems have also gone through major stat changes. In general, stats from Gems is lower than Runes at the lowest tier, but by mid-tier they're on par, and by high-tier they're better. They also have some different stats not found on Runes.
- New Stat Type: Chaos/Corrupted Stats! Players from Craft to Exile might be familiar with this. When using an Orb of Chaos, there is a 75% chance to give the gear a powerful Chaos stat. However, there is a 25% chance that the gear will turn into a lump of coal. Thanks Len for your help!
- Non-Magic Skills now take into account the Caster's weapon type. So the Skill's damage can benefit from stats like "Sword Damage" if the Caster is holding a sword.
- New currency which rerolls a random affix.
- Currency Potential has been reworked. Items start with Potential which gets deducted from with each currency. At 0 potential, you can no longer apply currencies.
