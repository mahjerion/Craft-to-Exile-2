### Gear/Stat Updates
- The Master Bag can now be slotted in a Curios slot, and there is a keybind to access it. The default keybind is: Alt + B.
- Gear Rarity stat scaling has been changed so there's no more overlap. For example, common now rolls 0-17% instead of 0-30%. This change also affects Support Gem stat rolls (no more uncommon Support Gem being better than rare). This ALSO means Mythics have been buffed since they roll from 86-100% instead of 75-100%.

- Cooldown Reduction no longer affects Charge Recovery Rate.
- Healing Received stat now applies to magic shield heals.
- New stat: Charge Recovery Rate. You'll find this new stat on the Talent Tree, Ascendancies, and on items where Trap CDR used to be. There are also some new instances of this.

The jewel stats have also been rebalanced so that jewels are not as overwhelmingly strong compared to normal nodes (they're still strong, just not as strong).
- Jewel Corrupted Affixes are now much better. Replaced Attack Speed on the Immunity to Agony affix with Energy. Also added a new one that gives Move and Attack Speed.
- Rebalanced the Crafted Jewel stats so they're more in line with what Jewels currently give. They're approximately x2 as powerful, as opposed to the previous 3-4x.
- Codex no longer pull from Corrupted Jewel Affixes and now only pull from Chaos Stats.
- Crafting Currencies have been revamped to be more player-friendly. No more chances of rolling penalty stats (can still corrupt or destroy though), less RNG, buffed currencies all around.

- Heretic Gamechanger Totem Cooldown Reduction reduced from 25% to 20%.
- Twincast Gamechanger now also grants Barrage.
- Harmony Gamechanger now grants 30% Magic Shield Healing instead of 50% (with the fix to how this stat works, it should still be way stronger than it was before).

- Increased the area of Magma Orb.
- Magma Orb cooldown reduced.
- Magma Orb now applies Scorched for 3s on hit, which reduces Elemental Resistances.

The heal value has been adjusted - the amount healed over 3s is roughly the same as the instant heal from before, meaning after 5s the heal is much greater. This does mean Frost Golems can no longer spam heals.
- Added a new Lv. 15 Chronomancer Skill: Conduction! This buff alters Zap and Cold Snap. Casting one of the skills will temporarily modify the other skill.

- Minor change but big impact: % x stat gained as y stat now has proper priority in calculations. This means something like Mantra, which grants % Mana gained as Flat Physical Basic Attack Damage no longer is calculated at the same time as % Health gained as Mana (thereby losing out on the bonus from Health). The general order (from first calculated to last) is: stats that scale from or into resources (Health per Mana, Armor per Mana, etc.) > general non-damage stat changes (includes defenses, regen, attributes) > damage stats, even if they scale off of Resources (Skill Damage per Magic Shield, Weapon Damage per Health, etc.) > functional/back-end stats (Draw Speed per Attack Speed, Weapon Skill Cooldown per Attack Speed).
