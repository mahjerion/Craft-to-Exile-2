### Updates
- Added a new PATREON-designed Unique! Thanks to quad01man for your support! The Written Word. This Unique Tome grants the user a new Skill called Grand Cross and provides the user with stats that would benefit a healer. If you would like to support me on Patreon, please visit https://www.patreon.com/crafttoexile!
- Added a new Necklace Runeword: Rain - a low-mid level Runeword for Totem users.
- New Skill: Grand Cross - deals Lightning damage in an area and heals allies around the caster 3 times.
- Added a new Hammer/Spear Runeword: Call to Arms - this Runeword grants you access to a new buff Skill, Battle Orders!
- New Skill: Battle Orders - increases nearby allies' Skill Damage, Health, and Magic Shield for a short duration. Higher levels increase the duration.
- Added 6 more new Uniques! Cloak of Defiance makes damage taken go to Mana instead of Health. Also find the Genji set (Helmet, Chest, Leggings, Boots) and receive a boost to your melee damage. Each piece of the set gives you a 25% chance to trigger the new Skill, Slice on each hit! This skill can only trigger once off cooldown. Lastly, also added Martyr's Blade which takes advantage of the Terrible Sword's self-damaging mechanic to do tons of damage!
- New Skill: Slice - deal Physical damage in an area around you.
- New Skill: Splinter - linked to Chilling Touch, summon hits can proc this Skill.
- The Terrible Sword is no longer craftable.
- Increased scaling of resources with damaging Skills, such as Gong Strike, Chain Lightning, etc.
- New Lv. 15 Shaman Skill: Galvanic Blade - imbue your weapon, converting your Physical damage into Lightning damage. Also gives your critical Lightning damage a chance to cast Discharge, which does Lightning damage in a small area around the struck enemy.
- New Lv. 25 Shaman Skill: Battery Fusillade - fire out a stream of Lightning orbs to wreak havoc on your foes. These orbs scale highly with Mana, and the Skill intrinsically provides Critical Damage boost.

- Improved Shaman Lightning Skill visuals.

- Lightning Spear projectile now lasts a bit shorter.
- New Lv. 20 Sorcerer Skill: Steam Cloud - provides the user with a stack of Heat that deals AOE Fire Damage every 0.5s around the caster. Each cast of Steam Cloud increases the effect stack by 1, further increasing the damage and area of Steam Cloud.
- New Lv. 15 Sorcerer Skill: Frost Armor - buffs the user, increasing their Magic Shield. Also causes Cold Damage on Frozen enemies to have a chance of casting Bone Shatter, which deals Cold and Physical damage in an area around the enemy.
- Fire Nova has been reworked into Magma Orb. Summon a fire orb at your position which pulsates every second, dealing fire damage in an area. After 3s, the orb explodes, dealing more damage in a larger area.
- Explosive Arrow, Meteor, Armageddon and Meteor Arrow no longer apply Elemental Weakness. Only the new Magma Orb, Fireball, Fire Trap, Flame Strike, and Magma Totem do.

- Poison Cloud now has increased Poison Chance that scales with the Skill's level.

- Reduced the Mana cost of Summon Skills by 25%.

- Return Summons no longer attempts to stun, slow, or damage your pets.
- Ritardando Slow has increased in duration by 66%.
- Resonance now fires 3 projectiles and travels very quickly.
- Resonance damage scaling has been increased. Technically, the damage scaling should have been lowered to compensate for the above, but it turns out I forgot to buff this Skill during one of my earlier buffs so the damage was lacking THAT much.

- Added Weapon Skill tag to some Skills that were missing (such as some Ranged Skills).

- Quests not found in the main Acts now provide experience scaled to your level. It's not a percentage, as it would be too strong at higher levels (people could just horde % rewards till 99), but it should tremendously help the leveling experience and reward players for doing non-M&S things.
- Diving Kit and Three-Bolt Helmet quests in Act III have been properly reassigned as Main Quests.
- Professions quests now also provide experience.
- Reduced experience rewards from Quests in the main Acts slightly.
- Made some changes to streamline quest progression. Also highlighted the Professions quest tab in a Prologue quest.

### Updates
#### Mine and Slash General Updates
- New EXPERIMENTAL Character Loadout feature! You can now have multiple characters saved on your account. You can switch between them through the Hub.
- Mine and Slash maps now have rollable tiers from 1-100. At higher tiers, more powerful Uniques will drop, and monsters will be more difficult and rewarding. The rarity of the map determines the rarity of map that can drop in the map. For instance, only Rare, Epic, and Legendary maps can drop in Epic maps.
- Map experience in lower tiers is reduced greatly. You will find better items and get more experience in higher tier maps (by a lot).
- Upped Map drop rates by 20%.
