## [0.9.5] - 2025-05-26

### Updates
- Added a bunch of choice Rune rewards as Campaign quest rewards.
- Reduced the number of required kills for kill quests across the board by about 25-30%.
- Increased chance of Runes in chests. It's approximately 15% now, up from 10%.
- Map default pack size has increased by about 33%.
- Obelisk mob spawn rates have increased drastically (more than double).
- Obelisk rewards now contain an increased chance at getting Runes, and a chance of High Runes. This is one of the only early-game sources of High Runes.
- Increased Prophecy Coin drop rate substantially.
- Prophecy rewards have been revamped. Lower rarities should appear less frequently, and costs have been reduced. You also now encounter Legendary and higher rarities at any level, instead of at higher level maps only. Legendary rarity rewards now start appearing at tier 20, and Mythics at 40, instead of 60+.
- Unique drop rates doubled.
- Added a new Map Prophecy Curse that reduces player Ailment Damage done.
- Map Affix that gives Mobs extra damage as an element has been changed back to conversion. However, they now also gain additional damage done in that element.

- Reduced Harvest mob spawns by 25%.
- Revamped Relics. The number you can add to a map has been lowered but the affixes have been  buffed drastically to compensate. You can have 1 Harvest, 1 Ancient Obelisk, and 3 Mine and Slash Relics.
- Dungeon Realm Relics have been folded into the base Mine and Slash Relics.
